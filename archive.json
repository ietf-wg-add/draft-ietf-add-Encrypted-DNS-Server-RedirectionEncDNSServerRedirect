      "body": "Per the existing guidance to not use lesser encryption in a redirect chain, a mechanism for tracking which servers are suitable (or not) for redirection will need to be maintained to avoid JIT or per-connection suitable redirect target detection. This at least dictates that a small cache should be maintained. This is likely to be neighbor-only but could potentially be handled by following a proposed redirection chain to the end and storing values (including TTLs). Additionally, a server could potentially choose to short-cut known existing chains based on TTLs of all paths en-route to the terminal server and supply the terminal server to the client directly.\r\n\r\nI think this very much fits into the 'server considerations' discussion and we could slide in a client comment if we feel it necessary.",
